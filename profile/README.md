### 🌟 About
**AIDE examples** is a series of applications demonstrating how to build professional software architectures using agent-based coding systems and AI-driven development.
Our mission is to explore the intersection of AI and software engineering, providing practical examples and tools for educational purpose.
The material provided in the project repositories was built in co-operation with AI agents (mainly *Anthropic Claude Monet*).
This means that less than 2% of the documentation and code you will find there was manually crafted.

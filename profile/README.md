<img src="AIDE.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right:20px;width:200px;"/> **AIDE Examples** is a series of applications demonstrating how to build professional software using agent-based development.

Our mission is to explore the intersection of AI and software engineering, providing practical examples for educational purpose.

All project repositories were built in co-operation with AI agents (mainly *Anthropic Claude Monet*).
Less than 2% of the documentation and code were manually crafted.
